# Sharemind Player
## A tool for auditing Sharemind Application Server audit logs.

This tool can be used to audit the computations of Sharemind miners via
analyzing the audit log files they produce. All individual protocols are also
simulated and results are automatically verified by comparing the simulation
result to the values contained in the audit log.

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* [Kivy 1.8](http://kivy.org/)
	* In Debian this means installing the `python3-kivy` package.

### Usage without installing (on Unix-like systems)

The command line tool:
> env PYTHONPATH=. scripts/smplayer &lt;log-file&gt;

The GUI tool:
> env PYTHONPATH=. scripts/smplayer-gui

### Installation

> ./setup.py install

### Usage

The command line tool:
> smplayer &lt;log-file&gt;

The GUI tool:
> smplayer-gui

Then click "Load audit log" to select an audit log to analyze.

There is an example log file at `test/data/audit.log`, which can be used to
test out the program. It should display everything as "ok".

### Run unit tests

> ./setup.py test
